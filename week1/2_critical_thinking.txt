---] 1.11 Critical Thinking

Critical thinking is an essential skill in many cybersecurity
career paths.
The definition may vary depending on the source, but esentially
critical thinking is controlled, purposeful thinking directed
toward a goal.

Critical thinking forces us to think and act in situations where there are no
clear answers nor specific procedures.
It is partly art and partly science.

Critical thinking is more important than ever in a world
where we have an overwhelming amount of information.

Note that Technical skills in cybersecurity for most big companies
are related to:
- Intrusion Detection
- Reverse Engineering
- Programming
- Virtualization
- Cryptography
- Networking
- Operating Systems
- Database Modeling

These are fundamental skills, of course tools and frameworks will change
often, but the reality is that security fundamentals change slowly.
The point is that critical thinking skills coupled with an understanding
of security fundamentals will allow us to identify solutions to unknown,
undefined and complex situations (regardless of technology).

Critical thinking is at the intersection between:
- Attitutes/Behaviours based on personal experience
- Technical Skills /Competencies (the ones listed above)
- Interpersonal Skills
- Theoritical and Experimental knowledge

The 5 key skills of critical thinking are:

1. Challenge assumptions
    - Systematically list and challenge
    - Refine as we learn more

2. Consider alternatives
    - Brainstorm full range of possibilities
    - Break into components, who/what/when/where/why/how?

3. Evaluate data
    - Crux of the scientific method
    - Does the data fit our hypothesis?

4. Identify key drivers
    - What are the driving forces at play?
    - This can help us identify the future

5. Understand context
    - MOST IMPORTANT!
    - Put ourselves in others' shoes - reframe the problem



---] 1.11.1 Critical Thinking: Challenge Assumptions

An asssumption is a thought that causes us to predict an outcomt,
usually it is based on a past experience or old thoughts and evidence.

We have to challenge our assumptions! This means that we
have to systematically list our assumptions and then assess whether
they are solid, they have caveats or are unsupported.

We also have to refine our assumptions as we learn more and
circumstances change.

Questions are converted into "collection requirements" (needing more hard
data) or "research topics" (needing more information).

The Key assumptions check can be subdivided into 5 steps:
1. Explicitly list all assumptions
    - inviting all stakeholders
    - brainstorming
    - look for phrases like "will always, will never,
      would have to be, based on, generally  the case..."
2. Examine each with questions
    - why do you think it is correct?
    - when could this be untrue?
    - how confident am I that this is valid?
    - if it is invalid, what would be the impact be?
3. Categorize based on evidence
    - solid and well-supported
    - correct (with caveats...)
    - unsupported/questionable - uncertainties
4. Refine and remove
    - remove assumptions that don't hold up
    - add new assumptions that emerge
5. Identify additional data needs
    - unsupported doesn't mean invalid
    - considera turning them into research topics
    - consider whether additional data should be collected


---] 1.11.2 Critical Thinking: Consider Alternative Explanations

Our brains can piece together a situation with just a few bits of data.
Failure to consider missing data or alternatives can lead us down
the wrong path.

How do we consider alternatives?
- Brainstorm
    - Get crazy
    - List all possibilities
    - Go from negative to positive
- The 6 W's
    - Provide framework
    - Who/what/when/where/why/how
    - Evaluate all dimensions
- Null Hypothesis
    - Establish the opposite of our main hypothesis
    - Useful for anomalous data

Adoid letting ourselves become entrenched in one explanation.

---] 1.11.3 Critical Thinking: Evaluate Data

We have to know our data, and know what does normal look like
in our scenario.
This is the key to anomaly detection.

We must establish a baseline for what's normal:
- web traffic
- network sensors
- endpoint activity
- sources/destinations
- volume/velocity
- ...

And we have to be on the lookout for inconsistent data.

NOTE: "cyber" data is notoriously hard to get because of
policy/privacy/collection e.g., GDPR, HIPAA issues.
So we must be proactive and understand what we will
need to troubleshoot problems and how to establish
what is normal.

---] 1.11.4 Critical Thinking: Identify Key Drivers

Key drivers significantly impact a situation.
These are the main key drivers of the cybersecurity,
so factors that have an impact on a situation and they are
not always technical.

- Technology: encrytpion, authentication, tools, frameworks, infrastructure availability
- Regulatory: privacy, intellectual property, safety regulations, GDPR/HIPAA/etc...
- Society: politics, public perception, expectation to keep data secure
- Supply Chain: customer requirements, logistics, cost, scheduling
- Employees, employee perspective, skills, training needs
- Threat Actors, technical capability, motives, opportunity

---] 1.11.5 Critical Thinking: Understand Context

Context is the operational environment in which we are working.
We have to cnsider the perspective of our managers, colleagues and clients.

What do they need from me? How can I frame this issue? Do I need to place
their questions in a broader context?

Framing techniques help keep everyone on the same page and use the same
vocabulary.

In order to "frame the issue", we shoud:
- identify the key components
- identify factors at play
- identify relationships
- ientify similarities/differences
- redefine

Think about the slow elevator problem, the solution may not be calling
the technician, but distract people with mirrors,
music or art displays to shorten the perceived wait time.

So if a problem can't be solved within the frame it was conceived, the solution
lies in reframing the problem.

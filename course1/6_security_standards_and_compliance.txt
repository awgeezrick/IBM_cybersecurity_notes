Security Standards and compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--] 1.0 - Introduction

Within Cybersecurity it is important to distinguish
between:
- Frameworks
- Best Practices
- Baselines
and
- Normative and compliance

First, it is important to understand frameworks, best practices and
baselines differ from normatives and compliance.

Because the first group is used to improve the controls, methodoloies
and governance for the IT departments or the global behavior of the
organization. They seek to improve performance, controls and metrics
and additionally help to translate the business needs into technical
or operational needs.
Basically best practices, baselines and frameworks are more suggestions
and they may not be followed strictly or at all.

Examples of best practices used by IT security companies:
- COBIT
- ITIL
- ISOs (27000 series)
- COSO
- PMI (Project Management methodologies)
- Industry Best Practices
- Developer recommendations
- others


On the contrary, normatives and compliance are rules to follow for
a specific industries. For example, HIPAA must be followed
by any company in the health care in the US.
Enforcement for the government, industry or clients is mandatory
even if the company or the organization does not want to implement
those controls, whenever there is a compliance need.




--] 1.1 - IT Governance Process

The IT governance process is part of an organization and comprehends:
- Policies
    Those plans (tactical and strategic) are enforced by policies
- Strategic and Tactic Plans
    Each organization must have a set of strategic plans based
    on the goals and objectives. The tactic plans is basically
    how we can implement a strategic plan.
- Procedures
    Each policy may have a procedure associated with details
    regarding the operative process
- Others
    Could be other documents such as guidelines, baselines,
    standards and technical procedures



--] 1.2 - Cybersecurity Compliance and Audit Overview

Examples of compliance that must be followed by companies
are:

- SOX       (financial systems compliance)
- GLBA      (financial systems compliance)
- HIPPA     (healthcare systems compliance)
- PCI/DSS   (credit card payment systems compliance)

For example online stores need to comply with PCI/DSS.
Companies who comply with PCI/DSS must perform pentests
on a regular basis.

Companies that want to check a satisfaction with respect to a specific 
compliance standard or framework must perform what is called an
"audit".

Audits can be internal or external. Internal audits are performed by
internal audit department. External audits are audits performed
by third-party companies.

Audits can be performed by keeping into account the OCTAVE framework
described here:

--] 1.3 - Pentest - Ethical Hacking

Pentest is a method of evaluating computer and network security by
simulating an attack on a computer system or network from external and
internal threats.

A sample procedure for pentesting is the one shown by Mile 2 CPTE Training.

Remember that an audit is not a pentest and a pentest is not necessarily
part of an audit.


For pentesting Web applications or mobile applications we can observe
the OWASP framework.

---] 1 - Cybersecurity Definitions

NIST defines cybersecurity or information security as:
 "The protection of information systems from unauthorized:
  access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction
  in order to provide confidentiality, integrity and availability."

These three principles of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
are known as the **CIA Triad**.

- Confidentiality
    is synonymous with privacy. Confidentiality measures
    prevent data from falling into the hands of people who do not have
    authorization to access said information;
    Confidentiality is often obtained with encryption techniques
    and enforced with access controls (authentication,authorization)
    and physical security.
- Integrity
    is about making sure information is accurate and
    always remains the same;
    Integrity is generally checked by using hash functions.
- Availability
    is about keeping system working and requires routine
    maintenance and upgrading of hardware, software and operating system
    environments;
    Availability is ensured in different ways, e.g., backups, RAID,
    clusters of servers, ISP redundancy (more than one internet connection),
    UPS.

Another key term used is Non-Repudiation, that is, a valid proof of the
identity of the data sender or receiver.
Technical implementations are performed through:
- Digital Signatures
- Logs

---] 1.1 - Main Terms

Four key terms are:
- Asset
    An asset is anything of value, e.g., people, property, information.
    Property assets consist of both tangible and intangible items that
    can be assigned a value.  Information may include databases, software
    code, critical company records, and many other intangible items.
    An asset is what we are trying to protect.
- Vulnerability
    a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited
    to violate a system security policy;
    A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts.
- Threat
    is an event, natural or man-made, able to cause negative impact
    to an organization, like a hurricane, a fire or an hacker;
    A threat is what weâ€™re trying to protect against.
- Expoit
    is a defined way to breach the security of an IT system through
    a vulnerability;
- Risk
    it is a situation involving exposure to danger, or the likelihood
    of a vulnerability to be exploited;
    Risk can be thought of as the intersection of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
    Indeed it is, Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk.

Please, note that many if not most threats come from the inside (Internal Factors).


---] 1.3 - Vulnerability Assessment

A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying,
analyzing, and ranking vulnerabilities in a specific environment.


---] 1.4 - Roles in Cybersecurity

Here we report a common list of roles used by companies involved with
cybersecurity. Note that although the list tries to be as general as
possible, many companies adopt custom role names.

- CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)
    this is a fairly new role and was created to make sure
    there is a head and someone in charge of the information
    security division to supervise and be the leader of the
    infosec tower;

- Information Security Architect;

- Information Security Consultant/Specialist

- Information Security Analyst
    this is the day-to-day person in charge of conducting basic
    information security assessments and more specifically analyzing
    the events, alerts, alarms and any information that could be
    useful to identify any threats that could compromise the
    organization. So basically it gets events from a SIEM
    and conducts an investigation to understand what it is
    about and how to prevent the alert from popping up, e.g.,
    modifying IPS/IDS configuration;

- Information Security Auditor
    this person checks if a computer systems is following the best
    practices outlined by standards, such as ISO-27001 or ISO27002;

- Security Software Developer

- Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker (part of the red team);

- Vulnerability Assessor

- Digital Forensic Analyst (part of the blue team)

- SIEM Engineer
    (part of the blue team),
    the person responsible for the tuning and configuration
    of a SIEM platform;


---] 1.4 - History of Cybersecurity

The main major factors that contributed to the rise
of cybersecurity during history are:
- Reagan
- 9/11
- Pervasive use of technology (everybody with a phone)

Everything started with Ronald Reagan a US president that also was a
Hollywood actor. Reagan asked to his security advisor if what he saw on
"Wargames" could be real.  Reagan powers the NSA and other commands in
the US to deal with the cyberspace.
Ronald Reagan was the first American president who recognized the
need for a national policy on cybersecurity.

Then, the government started to think about how to avoid another 9/11,
Peal Harbor in the US.  But also how to avoid damage to fundamentala
infrastructures.
Note that many of the cybersecurity operations deployed by the US
government like STUXNET or mass-surveillance programs was because of
the 9/11 twin towers attack.

At the end, the pervasive use of technology boosted again the interest
in cybersecurity, being the third major factor that contributed to the
rise of cybersecurity attention in the US, also because not only it means
that anybody can be vulnerable but also that anybody could potentially
start an attack.


---] 1.5 - Early Operation Attempts and Some Victories

- Clipper Chip
    Chip developed by NSA that should have been used by
    phone companies to encrypt communications,
    but never really used and cancelled in 1996. The main cause was that
    it was proprietary and most likely vulnerable.
- Moonlight Maze
    was a 1999 US government investigation into a massive
    data breach of classified information coming from a MainFrame in
    Moscow. Moonlight Maze represents one of the first widely known
    cyber-espionage campaigns in world history. I
- Solar Sunrise
    another investigative operation by US after an advanced
    attack to important US departments, the attackers were two teens from
    California and an israeli hacker (known as "the analyzer" or "pink pony"),
    around 2000.
- Buckshoot Yankee
    this is the most significant breach by US military
    systems, which was deployed as a series of compromises in 2008.
    The attackers used a trojan known as "Agent.BTZ" which stayed on the systems
    for 14 months. Nobody understood where the attack came from, but an hypothesis
    says from China.
- Desert Storm
    this was a real military operation but comprehending a cyber
    component, early '90s.
- Bosnia
    this was a real military operation but comprehending a cyber
    component, early '90s.


---] 1.6 - Cybersecurity Today in Numbers

- Every year we have more or less 10k of newly found vulnerabilities;
- Cybercrime costs about 100 bilions of USD only in the US;
- Every year about 400 bilions of USD are spent for cyberattacks around the world;
- In 2019 the data lost cost was about 2.1 bilions of dollars;

To have some yearly numbers about cybersecurity we can use the:
"X-Force Threat Intelligence Index", which is a yearly report.


---] 1.7 - Cybersecurity Difficulties

Performing effective cybersecurity is difficult because nowadays
we have to deal with very diverse aspects and the amount of
data into play is huge.
The aspects to keep into account are:

- Data and its Protection
    There are multiple ways to protect data and multiple types
    of data, consider also non-electronic data
- Diverse Technology
    Data is no longer only in notebooks, workstations or mainframes,
    but mobile devices such tablets, smartphones and other appliances
    have confidential data to monitor and protect
- Global Business
    We generally need to protect more than one office in different
    countries
- Multiple Vendors/Technologies
    We make use of different technologies and multiple vendors
    while eeverything must be able to communicate

---] 1.8 - Cybersecurity Program: Considerations

Here we describe what are the considerations that must be taken into
account to start a cybersecurity program.

- Define a "Security Program"
- Manage the Asset
- Technical Controls
- Administrative Controls


---] 1.8.1 - Define a Security Program

In order to start in the cyber security arena, we must have what is called
a "cybersecurity program", where specialists evaluate, create teams,
establish baselines, identify and model the threats, use cases, risks
and define a monitoring an control strategy for the risks and threats
identified.

---] 1.8.2 - Manage the Asset

We have to identify all the assets which does not refer to the
computers we have in front of us, but it is about documents, 
systems and resources.

So basically we have to:
- identify the assets;
- classify the assets;
- control its CIA;
- implement proper access control for each asset;

---] 1.8.3 - Technical Controls

We have to define:
- network infrastructure;
- protection endpoints;
- UTMs (Unified Threat Management Systems);
- identity management;
- vulnerability management;
- monitoring and logging;


---] 1.8.4 - Administrative Controls

We also have to define what are called "Administrative Controls":
- policies;
- procedures;
- standards;
- user education procedures;
- incident response plans;
- disaster recovery procedures;
- compliance and physical security;

---] 1.9 What is security ?

NIST defines Computer Security as:
"The protection afforded to an automated information system
in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity,
availability and confidentiality of information system resources includes
hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications."

Cybersecurity is used interchangeably with "Computer Systems Security".

The difference between information security and cybersecurity, is
related to the scope. Indeed cybersecurity is more involved with the
information processed by electronic systems, which nowadays is the most
common solution.  While in the past also physical documents security was
of paramount importance hence the information security field has a more
wide scope.


---] 1.10 Additional Security Challenges

- Security is not as simple as it seems: easy requirements tough solutions
- Solutions can be attacked themselves
- Protection of enforcement structure can complicate solutions
- Security architectural decisions: know what to do, and where
- Key management is really hard, generation, distribution, memorization of keys
- Protectors have to be "right" all the time, attackers just once
- No one likes security until it's needed, seat-belt philosophy,
  remember that a seat-belt costs around 200 USD, but its value
  is about milions of USD when it is saving your life
- Security architectures require constant effort
- Security is often a decision after thought
- Security is viewed as "in the way", hence not something good
  for some companies


---] 1.11 Resources for penetration testers

Resources available to help guide penetration testing efforts by cybersecurity
specialists are:
- OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
- EFIEC Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Information Technology Examination
- NIST SP 800-42 Guidelines on Network Security Testing

According to the Vulnerability Assessment Methodology, Vulnerabilities are determined
by two factors:
- exposure and sensitivity YES ??
- identify indicatorrs and exposure ?
- sensitivity and adaptive capacity (NO)

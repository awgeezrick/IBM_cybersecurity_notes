Access Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--] 1 - Authorization

Authorization can be performed using different criteria:
- groups
- time frame and/or specific dates
- physical location
- transaction type

We sometimees just need to access certain information
for the role, this is called "need_to_know".

Generally in the enterprise mechanisms such as SSO (Single Sign-On)
are used.

--] 2 - Authentication

On most systems, identification is performed coupled
with authentication.
For the identification we generally have to provide
an identity information, such as a username, this
is called "identity proof".

Two enterprise authentication techniques are:
- Kerberos (SSO)
- Mutual Authentication (e.g., MS-CHAPv2)

In Active Directory (AD) we have SID as identity proof, used to identify
users and more generallly objects in Active Directory environments.
For the authorization part,  most OSes implement at least Discretionary
Access Control Lists (DACL), which is used also in AD, and basically lets
each user decide for its own files what to share with who.

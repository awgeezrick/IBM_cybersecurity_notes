Types of actors and motivations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--] 1 - Actors and Motivations

The **actors** involved within cyber attacks can be summarized as:

- Internal Users
    They are still the most likely to cause security problems,
    whether intentional or not. Loss and sale of information
    is the most normal, along with the installation of malware
- Hackers (pay or not)
    These are attackers that may be paid by private or public
    organizations. Or simply someone with enough knowledge and
    time to bother
- Hacktivism
    Similar to governments but usually do not have much financial
    power. Normally they reveal sensitive or confidential information
    to the public and carry out DDoS campaign
- Governments
    They have enough power to cause very large financial and operational
    losses, it is normal to attack infrastructure, spy and monitor
    important politicians and are the most used APT (advanced
    persistent threat)

**Motivations** can be summarized as:
- Just play
    Demonstrate the capabilities of the individual/group
    on the hackers community
- Gain money
    In conjunction with governments or criminal organizations
- Political action and movements
    Make a statement or fight for a specific reason
- Hire me
    Demonstrate what can I do for somebody to hire me or use my
    services

- WannaCry (Lazarous and North Korea)


--] 4 - Security Attacks

Here we follow Stallings and ITU X.800 definitions.

An attack is an action by a human with intent to violate
security.
It does not matter if the attack succeeds it is still
considered an attack even if it fails.

Security attacks can be broadly classified into
Passive and Active attacks.

We can distinguish between:
- Passive Attacks (hard to detect)
    - such as eavesdropping or traffic pattern analysis
    - they can run for years
- Active Attacks (easier to detect, but difficult to prevent)
    - explicit interception and modification
    - several classes of these attacks exist but generally involve:
        - masquerade (aka spoofing),
            An opponent impersonates a known or authorized person or
            system. Here there is a violation on identification
            and authentication
            This is an attack to confidentiality
        - replay
            A copy of a legitimate message is captured by an opponnent
            and re-transmitted. This is an attack on the integrity of the
            system's data.
            These represent MiTM attacks, where valid data transmission is maliciously 
            or fraudulently repeated or delayed
            This is an attack to integrity
        - modification
            The content of a legitimate message is altered.
            An instance of this can be MiTM attacks with modification.
            This is an attack to integrity
        - denial of service
            an opponent prevents authorized users from accessing a system
            this is an attack on the availability of the system

An attack could be composed of more of these elements, e.g., masquerade, 
replay, modification.

--] 5 - Security Services

A security service is a processing or communication service that is provided
by a system to give a specific kind of protection to a system resource.
Security services implement (are technical implementation of) security policies
and are implemented by security mechanisms. (Stallings and RFC 2828)


Security services in a company are used to prevent or counter security
attacks.

With security services we generally try to replicate functions
normally associated with physical documents, e.g., applying dates
and signatures, protection from disclosure or destruction; be notarized
or witnessed; be recorded or licensed.

The main security services described also by X.800 by ITU are:
- Authentication
    assurance that communicating entity is the one
    claimed. We can distinguish two types of authentication:
        - peer-entity authentication
            (users can authenticate each other)
        - data origin authentication
            (one user can look at data and understand from who it comes from)
- Access Control
    prevention of the unauthorized use of a resource,
    which comprehends:
        - identification
        - authentication
        - authorization
- Data Confidentiality
    protection of data from unauthorized disclosure
- Data Integrity
    assurance that data received is as sent by an authorized entity
- Non-Repudiation
    protection against denial by one of the parties in a
    communication. So basically Alice and Bob can't say
    "I didn't do that", so identification, authentication
    and confidentiality are involved
- Availability
    resource is accessible and usable


--] 6 - Security Mechanisms

Stallings says that security mechanisms are a combination of
hardware, software and processes that implement a specific security
policy.

For example: protocol suppression, usage of an ID and authentication,
and so on.

Mechanisms use security services to enforce security policies.

A security mechanism (or security enforcement point) is a
technical implementation of a security policy.
While a security policy is derived from a business policy.

A business policy describes what we are going to do.
A security policy describes how we are going to do it.
A security mechanism (or security enforcement point) are the 
technical implementation of that security policy.

An example would be, we can say that everything starts
from business policy e.g., no large-data movements on a server without
especially without encryption.
The security policy associated would be "disable FTP", which describes
how we are going to do it. And the security mechanism is represented
by a configuration disabling FTP. So the security mechanism in this
case is using as security service the Access Control.

So again remember from a higher to a lower point of view we have:

Business policy --> Security Policy --> Security Mechanism

Major specific security mechanisms include:
- Cryptography
- Digital Signatures
- Access Controls
- Data integrity techniques
- Authentication exchange
- Traffic padding
- Routing control
- Notarization
- ...

Pervarsive security mechanisms instead include:
- trusted functionality
- security labels
- event detection
- security audit trails
- security recovery



--] 7 - Network Security Models


A model for network security
involves two parties trying to communicate with
confidentiality, integrity and accessability.


Message -> Transformation -> Source Message ---+
   |            |                              |
   v            v                              |
Sender    Secret Info                          v
                                           +-------+
                                           |   C   |
                                           |   h   |
                                           |   a   |
                      Opponent -------->   |   n   | 
                                           |   n   |
                                           |   e   |
                                           |   l   |
Recipient    Secret Info                   +---+---+
   |             |                             |    
   v             v                             |    
Message <- Transformation <- Source Message ---+

        Fig. 1 Network Security Model


Where both sender and recipient must have a trusted third party,
such as an arbiter, a distributor of secret information.

Using this model requires us to:
1. Design a suitable algorithm for the security transformation
2. Generate the secret information (keys) used by the algorithm
3. Develop methods to distribute and share the secret information
4. Specify a protocol enabling the principals to use the transformation
   and secret information for a security service

By X.800 context section A.2.1 we have the definition
of security. 

In terms of security architecture, by security we mean
"minimizing the vulnerabilities of assets annd resources.

An asset is anything of value.
A vulnerability is any weakness that could be exploited to violate
a system or the information it contains.

A threat is a potential violation of security.

ITU also states that we may need to protect:
- data and information;
- communication and data processing services;
- equipment and facilities;


--] 8 - Threats

- Malwares
- APTs
- Botnets

--] 8.1 - Threats: Malwares

Malware stands for "Malicious software", the term was coined
by Yisrael Radai in 1990.

The main types of malware are:
- Virus
    a piece of malicious code that spreads from one computer to another
    by attaching itself to other files using self replication,
    requires human intervention to self replicate.
    They use hiding techniques and are quite hard to remove since
    they duplicate on a system. It may use polymorphic code
    to bypass AVs.
  
- Worms
    Worms are self-replicating malwares that do not require human
    interactions, the goal is to just spread and cripple resources
    or turn computers into zombies.

- Trojan Horses
    These are hidden malwares that cause damage to a system or gives
    an attack access to the host. They are generally shipped
    asa vending package, a game, a wallpaper or any kind of download.

- Spyware
    These are malwares with the main goal of tracking and reporting
    the usage of the host or to collect data that the attacker desires
    to obtain, usch as browsing history, marketing information or any
    kind of files the attacker wants to chase.
    
- Adware
    Adware, is code that automatically displays or downloads unsolicited
    advertisements, usually seen on a browser pop-up.

- RATs (Remote Access Tool)s
   Remote Access Tools (or Remote Access Trojans) allow attackers to
   gain unauthorized access and control the victim computer

- Rootkit
    A piece of software intended to take full or partial control of
    a system at the lowest level.

- Ransomware
    These are malwares that restrict the access of to a computer or to
    the data in it. The attacker demands a ransom to be paid to get
    the data back. Generally if it is not paid within a certain amount
    of time, the data will be destroyed.
    A famous ransomware was the WannaCry.

- Keyloggers
    Software that records every keystroke made by a user.

- Logic Bombs
    Code that it's dormant and gets triggered by specific event,
    and once triggered it performs what it was programmed to do.
    Usually they erase or corrupt computer data.

NOTE: An application that runs on your computer without your authorization
but does no damage to the system is not considered malware.

--] 8.2 Threats: APTs

- APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat)s
    It's a kind of software used to monitor and log data for a long
    period of time designed specifically to stay undetected.
    It generally targets governments, financial corps, or 
    companies that have high value information.
    APTs are developed particularly for a specific customer and occur
    over a long period of time.

--] 8.3 - Threats: Botnets

A botnet is a set of compromised hosts that enables attackers
to exploit those computer resources to mount attacks.
These are used by black-hat hackers in operations such as
spam, DoS, phishing and spyware, mining personal information or
crypto-currency.

The computers taking part to a botnets are also called "zombies",
that are controlled from a "bot master" or a "bot herder".


--] 8.4 Threats: How to protect

We can protect ourselves against cyber-threats by implementing,
- Technical Controls:
    - AV
    - IDS / IPS / UTM
    - Updates
- Administrative Controls:
    - Policies
    - Training
    - Revisions and Tracking

--] 9 - Internet Security Threats

- Mapping and Scanning 
    Contermeasures:
        - Record traffic entering the network
        - Look for suspicious activity
        - Use a host scanner and keep a good
          inventory of hosts on the network
          creating a whitelist for "ok" environment

- Packet Sniffing
    Countermeasures:
        - check periodically if NICs are set into promiscuous mode
          if this is true, it means that the machine may be used
          to sniff traffic for other machines

- IP Spoofing
    Countermeasures:
        - (Partial Solution, only applicable in certain cases)
          Ingress filtering, so that routers do not forward outgoing
          packets with invalid source addresses

- DoS Attacks
    Countermeasures:
        - Filter out flooded packets (e.g., SYN)
          before reaching the host, throw out good with bad
        - Traceback to source of floods (most likely an
          innocent, compromised machine)

- Host Insertions, ability to place an insider computer with malicious intent
    Countermeasures:
        - Maintain an accurate inventory of computer hosts by MAC address
        - Use a host scanning capability to match discoverable hosts
          against known inventory
        - Missing hosts are ok
        - New hosts are not ok (red lights and siren :) )

- Rogue Software Process
    These are used to monitor network traffic or exfiltrate sensitive data
    They can be either put intentionally or being authorized programs that
    have been modified
    Countermeasures:
        - Maintain a whitelist of legitimate applications


--] 10 - Attacks and Cyber Crime Resources


--] 10.1 - Cyber Kill Chain

A kill chain is a set of activities that needs to be done to compromise
a victim.

The phases of the Intrusion Kill Chain are:

- Reconnaissance
    Research, identification and selection of targets
- Weaponization
    Pairing remote access malware with exploit into
    a deliverable payload (e.g., Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office File)
- Delivery
    Transmission of weapon to target (e.g., via email attachments, websites,
    USB devices)
- Exploitation
    Once delivered, the weapon's code is triggered, exploiting vulnerable
    applications or systems
- Installation
    The weapon installs a backdoor on a target's system allowing persistent
    access
- Command & Control
    Outside server communicates with the weapons providing "hands on keyboard"
    access inside the target's network
- Actions on Objective
    The attacker works to achieve the objective of the intrusion, which can
    include exfiltration or destruction of data, or intrusion inside another
    target


Note that often "Social Engineering" is a key part inside a Cyber Kill Chain.
This is about tricking people to do things that they would not normally do.

Phishing campaigns are also very common and are nowadays created by using
gophish.
Also Vishing is another technique used nowadays, where we still use
social engineering, but instead of e-mails we use our own voice;
Indeed, phones are a typical tool for vishing.


--] 12 - Cyberwar

We can analyze the cyberwar situation from the CSIS (Center for strategic
and international studies) website under "Significant Cyber Incidents".

Notice that in cyberwarfare whenever there is an operation or an attack
we rarely can know if these are performed by groups of hackers
which are state-sponsored or not.

One book richly describing cyberwarfare is "Countdown To Zero Day",
which tells the story of STUXNET.
written by one of the top cybersecurity journalist "Kim Zetter".


--] 12 - Cybercrime

We have different resources online to use for CyberCrime,

- CyberCrime Reports (X-Force)
    - https://www.ibm.com/security/xforce
    - https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach 
      (can estimate approximately how much a data breach would cost to us)


--] 13 - Other

To quiz one, vulnerability is identified by potential impact
and adaptive capacity.

NOTE: X-Force reports are created by the IBM research center.

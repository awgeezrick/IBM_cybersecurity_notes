--] 1 - Firewalls

Firewalls are protection mechanisms used to isolate
a network segment from other network segments,
allowing some packets to pass while blocking others.

There are three main types of firewalls:
- Packet-Filtering Firewalls
    Blocking on a packet basis, frequently depending
    on source/dest IP, TCP/UDP source/dest port,
    ICMP message type or TCP SYN/ACK bits
    An example would be blocking inbound TCP
    segments with ACK=0 to prevent external
    clients from making TCP connections with
    internal clients, but allows internal clients
    to connect to outside
- Application-Level Firewalls (or application gateways)
    These filter packets on application data as well
    as on IP/TCP/UDP fields
    Example: allow to select internal users to telnet
    outside
- XML Gateways: used to examine the payload of
   an XML message, a format widely used in enterprise
   applications. It generally checks if the message
   is well-formed, if there is no executable code,
   if the source and target IP addresses make sense


Limitagions of firewalls are:
- IP Spoofing, cannot be detected
- if multiple applications need special configuration,
  each of these must have its own gateway
- client software must know how to contact gateway,
  e.g., must set IP address of proxy in web browser
- filters are generally all or nothing for UDP
- there is a tradeoff between:
    the level of communication with the outside world
    and
    the level of security


Firewalls can be divided into many types but a common
categorization is:
- Stateful, can work on the "state" of a communication,
  they are based on "state tables" that allow the firewall
  to compare current packets with previous packets.
  These firewalls are slower but more secure wrt stateless
  firewalls. Sometimes they are also called "application firewalls"
  because they are able to make decisions based on application 
  data (L7)
- Stateless, does not have the concept of state, it just
  acts as "packet filter" and generally it is used to filter
  packets on layer IP and layer TCP/UDP, the lack of
  state makes it less flexible and secure wrt stateful firewalls


Another common type of firewall is the "proxy firewall",
which is used to act as an intermediary server.
Proxies terminate connections anad initiate new ones, like
in a MiTM.
There are two 3-way handshakes between two devices communicating
through a proxy firewall.



--] 2 - Antivirus/Antimalware

An AV/AM is a specialized software that can detect, prevent and even
destroy a computer virus or malware.

Generally they use malware definitions and scan the system searching
for matches against the malware definitions.
These definitions get constantly updated by vendors.
Comparing hashes of files is how most detect malicious files on
your system, so signatures are represented by these hashes.

--] 3 - Cryptography

Cryptography is the way for secret writing.
Cryptography was used also in ancient times, e.g., the caesar cipher.

In practice we need to secure both data at rest and data in motion.

Cryptoanalysis is the science behind the understanding if a specific
cipher/algorithm is effective/reobust or vulnerable.

There are two main types of ciphers:
- stream ciphers, which encrypt info bit by bit
- block ciphers, which encrypt info by a specific amount of bits/bytes

Three main cryptographic tools are:
- Symmetric Cryptography
    - the same key is used to encrypt/decrypt
    - security depends on keeping the key secret at all times
    - strengths include speed and cryptographic strength per bit of key
    - the bigger the key the stronger the algorithm
    - key needs to be shared using a secure, out-of-band channel
    - DES, Tiple DES, AES are examples of symmetric encryption
- Asymmetric Cryptography
    - Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, created the Diffie-Hellman method
      which represents the fundamentals of asymmetric cryptography; they are
      indeed the pioneers of asymmetric crypto
    - uses two keys
    - one key can be made public, while the other must be kept secret
    - one for encryption and the other for decryption, whatever
      is encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key
      and viceversa
    - used in digital certificates
    - used in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
    - it uses "one-way" techniques  to generate the two keys. Like
      factoring prime numbers and discrete logarithm
    - it is generally slower than symmetric crypto, that's why most of
      the times, they are used together, e.g., https
- Hash functions
    - provides encryption using an algorithm and no key
    - a variable-lenght plaintext is "hashed" into a fixed-length hash value
      often valled "message digest" or simply a "hash"
    - if the hash of a plaintext changes, the plaintext itself has changed
    - SHA-1, MD5, are older algorithms prone to collisions
    - SHA-2, SHA-3 are newer algorithms


NOTE: One of the first commercially available encryption techniques
was DES, that was vulnerable to brute force attacks, then AES
came to replace it, which was more resilient wrt brute-force.

--] 3.1 Cryptography Attacks

The 5 most common forms of cryptographic attacks are:
- Brute Force, 
- Rainbow tables, compare huge list of hashes with a hash
- Social engineering, ask the password
- Known plaintext, we know the plaintext which generated a certain plaintext
                   and try to guess the key used to encrypt data
- Known ciphertext, we know the ciphertext which generated a certain plaintext,
                   and try to guess the key used to encrypt data

--] 4 Penetration Testing

Pentest, pen testing or ethical hacking, it is the practice
of testing a computer system, network or application
to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

During pentest is good to distinguish between the:
- pentester/ethical hacker
- threat actors
    an entity that is partially or wholly responsible for an incident
    or attack that affects or potentially affects an organization's
    security. Also referred to as malicious actor.
    There are different types of threat actors:
    - script kiddies
    - hacktivists
    - organized crime
    - insiders
    - competitors
    - nation states
        - Fancy Bears (APT28)
        - Lazarus Group
        - Starcruft (Group 123)
        - APT29

Common Pentest methodologies are:
- OSSTMM: Open Source Security Testing Methodology
- NIST SP 800-42
- FFIEC
- ISSAF
- PTES

During pentest we must understand how to test for vulnerabilities,
in this context we can use the Vulnerability Assessment Methodology.
In vulnerability assessment a pentester limits himself to just
run software as Nessus or OpenVAS to identify possible
vulnerabilities without explicitly exploiting them.

At http://www.letsrespondtoolkit.org/vulnerability-assessment
we can check a general methodology to perform vulnerability assessment.

There are four steps to conducting a vulnerability assessment, there are:
Step 1: Identify potential impacts of indicators
Step 2: Assess whether the impact will take place (exposure)
Step 3: Assess how important the risk is (sensitivity)
Step 4: Assess if you can respond to the risk (adaptive capacity)


Which states that:
Identify Indicators:
    - Exposure
    - Sensitivity

Exposure and Sensitivity represent the potential impacts, which,
coupled with "Adaptive Capacity" compose a "vulnerability".

    Fig. 1 - Characterization of a Vulnerability

     

Companies generally suggest to perform:
- Vulnerability Scanning
    FREQUENCY: Quarterly or bimonthly (more often for high risk systems),
               or whenever the vulnerability database is updated
    METHOD:
        - enumerate the network structure and determine the set of active
          hosts and associated software
        - ientifies a target set of computers to focus vulnerability
          analysis
        - identifies potential vulnerabilities on the target set
        - validates operating systems and major applications are
          up-to-date with security patches and software versions
- Penetration Testing
    FREQUENCY: Annually
    METHOD:
        - determine how vulnerable an organization's network is to penetration
          and the level of damage that can be incurred
        - tests the IT staff's response to perceived security incidents and
          their knowledge and implementation of the organization's security
          policy and system's security requirements
- Integrity Checkers
    FREQUENCY: Monthly and in case of a suspicious event
    METHOD:
        - detects unauthorized filee modifications


--] 5 - Digital Forensics    

Digital Forensics is a branch of forensic science and includes the
identification, recovery, investigation, validation and presentation
of facts regarding digital evidence found on computers or similar
digital storage media devices.

Dr. Edmond Locard is known as the french Sherlock Holmes, and is a pioneer
of forensic science.
Locard invented the "Locard's Exchange Principle" which states that:
The perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene
and leave with something from it, and both of these things can be
used as forensic evidence.

This principle is also true in digital forensic.

In forensic science it is important to talk about "Chain of Custody"
that refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail that
records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis and
deposition of physical or electronic evidence.

So the chain of custody is a document which reconstructs what has been
done with the evidence.

It is often a process that has been required for evidence to be
shown legally in court.

Some of the most common tools used in digital forensics are:
- Hardware:
    - Faraday Cage (isolate radio devices, wifi/phone, etc...)
    - Forensic laptops and power supplies, tool sets,
      digital cameras, acse folder, blank forms,
      evidence collection and packaging supplies, empty HD,
      hardware with blockers
- Software:
    - Volatility
    - FTK
    - EnCase
    - dd
    - Autopsy (the Sleuth Kit)
    - Bulk Extractor and many more

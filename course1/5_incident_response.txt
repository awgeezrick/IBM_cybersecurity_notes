Incident Management and Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computer security Incident management involves the monitoring
and detection of security events on a computer or a computer
network and the execution of proper resources to those events.
This means that an incident management team will regularly
check and monitor the security events occurring on a computer
and on the network.

Incident Response is a part within the more general incident
management activity.


--] 1 - Key Components of Incident Management

The four key components of incident management are:
- Events
    An observed change to the normal behavior of a system,
    environment, process, workflow or person. Examples:
    router ACLs were updates, firewall policy was pushed.
- Incident
    It is an event that negatively effects in some way
    the CIA triad of an organization in a way that impacts
    the business
- Response Team
    CSIRT (Computer Security Response Team) is a team that
    receives reports of security breaches, conducts
    analyses of the reports and responds to the senders.
    A CSIRT may be an established group or an ad-hoc assembly
- Investigation
    One important part performed by the CSIRT is represented
    by the investigation process, so that the incident
    may be avoided the next time.
    The investigation seeks to determine the circumstances
    of the incident. Every incident will warrant or require
    an investigation. Evidence is collected and the chain
    of custody is kept into account

--] 2 - Key Components of Incident Response

Other concepts to understand in the context of incident response are:
- E-Discovery
    Data inventory, helps to understand the current tech status,
    data classification, data management, we could use authorized
    systems. Understand how we control data retention and backup
    This is a baseline
- Automated Systems
    Usage of SIEM, SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and
    Response), UBA (User Behavior Analytics), big data analysis,
    honeypots/honeytokens, AI or other technologies we could enhance the
    mechanism to detect and control incidents that could compromise the
    tech environments
    NOTE: SOAR are like SIEM but comprehend more advanced functionalities
- BCP (Business Continuity Plan) & Disaster Recovery
    Understand the company in order to prepare the BCP. The BCP is a
    procedure that is used to guide the CSIRT or in general the whole
    organization as soon as something happens.  For example, how will our
    organization deal with a service going down for the next three or
    four hours? What will the IT be doing? How is the customer service
    going to deal with all the calls received? BIA (Business impact
    analysis) it's also good to have for a clear understanding of the
    critical business areas. Also indicate if a security incident will
    trigger the BCP or the disaster recovery Disaster Recovery is the
    process that we follow to recover all the business areas after a
    disaster occurs (which may be e.g., an hurricane or a cyber attack)
- Post-Incident
    Once we have recovered, we should understand what/who caused the
    incident and how it happened and how can we avoid it the next time.
    Here we apply Root-Cause analysis, hence we must understand the difference
    between an error, a problem and an isolated incident.
    Lessons learned (experience) and reports are key


--] 3 - Incident Response Process

Reference: CREST

In order to manage an incident, we can split the operations into three
phases:
1. Prepare
2. Respond
3. Follow Up

--] 3.1 - Incident Response Process: Phase I - Prepare

1. Conduct a criticality assessment for your organization
2. Carry out a cyber security threat analysis, supported by
   realistic scenarios and rehearsals
3. Consider the implications of people, process, technology
   and information
4. Create an appropriate control framework
5. Review your state of readiness in cyber security incident
   response


--] 3.2 - Incident Response Process: Phase II - Respond

1. Identify  cyber security incident
2. Define objectives and investigate situation
3. Take appropriate action (consider triggering the business
   recovery or continuity plan)
4. Recover systems, data and connectivity

--] 3.3 - Incident Response Process: Phase II - Follow Up

1. Investigate incident more thoroughly
2. Report incident to relevant stakeholders
3. Carry out a post-incident review
4. Communicate and build on lessons learned
5. Update key information, controls and processes
6. Perform trend analysis
    understand what are the wrong behavior and consider
    to conduct a security awareness program to employees
    if a certain incident happens frequenty (e.g., bad USB
    dropped in the parking lot)

This is a lot of information, that we can view especially once we know
more about incident response.
